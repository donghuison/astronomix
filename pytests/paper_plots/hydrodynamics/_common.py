"""Shared helpers for the hydrodynamics forward-test methods-paper figures.

Provides the shared cache/figure directories, the ``--rerun`` command-line
check and the consistent solver colours used across the double-blast, Sedov,
shock-tube and sound-wave figures. Every generator caches its simulation output
under ``data/`` (numpy ``.npz``) and regenerates its figure from that cache
unless ``--rerun`` is passed, so the plots can be re-styled without re-running
any simulation.

``astronomix`` is installed non-editably in site-packages, so run the scripts
with the repo on PYTHONPATH and GPU selection through autocvd, e.g.

    PYTHONPATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) python paper_plots/hydrodynamics/double_blast.py
