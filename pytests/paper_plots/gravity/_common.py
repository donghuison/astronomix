"""Shared helpers for the self-gravity methods-paper figures.

Every script in ``paper_plots/gravity`` imports the scheme definitions,
consistent labels/styles, the Pallas backend configuration and a couple of
plotting utilities from here, so the four figures stay visually and
terminologically consistent.

``astronomix`` is installed non-editably in site-packages, so run the scripts
with the repo on ``PYTHONPATH`` to pick up this worktree, e.g.

    PYTHONPATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) python paper_plots/gravity/jeans_convergence.py

Each script caches its simulation output under ``data/`` (``jnp.savez``) and
regenerates the figure from that cache unless ``--rerun`` is passed, so plots
can be re-styled without re-running any simulation.
