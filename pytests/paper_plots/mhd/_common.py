"""Shared helpers for the MHD forward-test methods-paper figures.

Every script in ``paper_plots/mhd`` caches its simulation output under
``data/`` (``jnp.savez``) and regenerates the figure from that cache unless
``--rerun`` is passed, so the plots can be re-styled without re-running any
simulation.

``astronomix`` is installed non-editably in site-packages, so run the scripts
with the repo on ``PYTHONPATH`` to pick up this worktree, e.g.

    PYTHONPATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) python paper_plots/mhd/orszag_tang.py
