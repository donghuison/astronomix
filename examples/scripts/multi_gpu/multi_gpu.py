"""
Multi-GPU: run a 3D driven-turbulence simulation sharded across several GPUs.

The primitive state and helper data are domain-decomposed with a NamedSharding
(split along the x axis); astronomix performs the inter-device halo exchange
automatically. Change ``NUM_GPUS`` and the mesh split to scale to more devices.

Building the sharded initial state — three strategies, from simplest to most
memory-efficient:

1. Generate on one GPU, then shard::

       state = construct_primitive_state(...)        # full state on GPU 0
       state = jax.device_put(state, sharding)        # redistribute

   Simplest, but the entire state (and every intermediate field) must fit on a
   single device first and is then copied device-to-device — a memory and
   bandwidth bottleneck that caps the resolution at what one GPU can hold.

2. Generate on the host (CPU), then distribute to all GPUs::

       with jax.default_device(jax.devices("cpu")[0]):
           state = construct_primitive_state(...)     # full state in host RAM
       state = jax.device_put(state, sharding)         # scatter to the GPUs

   Lifts the single-GPU memory limit (host RAM is usually much larger), but
   builds the state on the slow CPU and pays a full host->device transfer.

3. Generate directly on the individual GPUs (used here)::

       initial_state = jax.jit(build_initial_state, out_shardings=sharding)()

   ``jit`` + ``out_shardings`` lets XLA partition the whole construction, so
   every device only ever computes and stores *its own shard* of each field and
   of the assembled state. No single device holds the full state and there is no
   post-hoc reshuffle — the most memory-efficient and fastest option at scale.

Two further memory savers used below:
  * the initial state is assembled inside ``build_initial_state`` so the
    intermediate density / velocity / magnetic-field arrays are local and freed
    once the state is built (only the final state survives the ``jit``);
  * ``donate_state=True`` lets the integrator reuse the input state buffer, and
    the low-storage ``RK4_LSRK`` integrator keeps one fewer full-state buffer
    than the default SSPRK4 (trading a little CFL margin for memory).
